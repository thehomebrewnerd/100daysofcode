# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Forked GitHub repo and personalized files. Added several reference links.

**Thoughts:** There are two main things I would like to accomplish duing my 100 days:
1. I want to build a successful AI Bot that will be able to successfully play (dare I say master) a classic video game (think Atari or NES). Why? Becasue I want to improve not only my coding skills but learn more about AI and reinforcement learning in particular.
2. I want to learn to develop and deploy web applications with Django. Why? I have an idea for a new web app that I want to develop. Why Django? I am already pretty familiar with Python so Django seems like a good place to start.
