# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Forked GitHub repo and personalized files. Added several reference links. Worked through [this tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-an-ai-game-bot-using-openai-gym-and-universe-f2eb9bfbb40a) on building an AI game bot. Attempted to change the game to an Atari 2600 game but got stuck with the required libraries not installing correctly. Pushed all the updated code to GitHub

**Thoughts:** There are two main things I would like to accomplish duing my 100 days:
1. I want to build a successful AI Bot that will be able to successfully play (dare I say master) a classic video game (think Atari or NES). Why? Becasue I want to improve not only my coding skills but learn more about AI and reinforcement learning in particular.
2. I want to learn to develop and deploy web applications with Django. Why? I have an idea for a new web app that I want to develop. Why Django? I am already pretty familiar with Python so Django seems like a good place to start.

**Link to work:** Nothing for today - stay tuned!

### Day 2: Jan 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got the right OpenAI libraries installed for Atari games. Followed [these instructions] (https://gym.openai.com/docs/) for the initial install. Then I installed `cmake` with the command `brew install cmake` since I'm running OSX. Finally, I installed the Atari dependencies with these [instructions](https://github.com/openai/gym#atari). Got a basic Ms. Pacman game running with random moves for now.

**Thoughts:** Not a lot of coding today - mostly reading and installing the right libraries so I can do what I want in the future. Gotta start somewhere!
