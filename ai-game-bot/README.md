## AI Game Bot Development
This directory contains code files for development of an AI game bot. Most of this code was created by reading through
the information that can be found in the [Resources](https://github.com/NateParsons/100-days-of-code/blob/master/resources.md) file in the rood directory of this repository.

`simple-ms-pacman.py`
Starts a Ms. Pacman game and moves around randomly. Not too exiting but a first step to playing Atari games with AI.

`pong-bot.py`
This is the code for developing a bot that can beat Pong using a Neural Network. This work comes from these references:
1. [Deep Reinforcement Learning: Pong from Pixels](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/)
2. [Write an AI to win at Pong from scratch with Reinforcement Learning](https://medium.com/@dhruvp/how-to-write-a-neural-network-to-play-pong-from-scratch-956b57d4f6e0)

`game-bot.py`
Very first attempt at creating a bot by following along with [this tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-an-ai-game-bot-using-openai-gym-and-universe-f2eb9bfbb40a).
